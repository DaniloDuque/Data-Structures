# Trie Trees

## Overview

Trie trees, also known as digital trees or prefix trees, are tree-like data structures that are used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually sequences, such as words in a dictionary. The name "trie" comes from the word "retrieval," emphasizing the structure's efficiency in searching and retrieval operations.

## How Trie Trees Work

A trie is a tree structure where each node represents a single character in a string. The root of the trie is associated with an empty string, and each edge from a node to its child represents a character. Nodes along the path from the root to a particular node concatenate to form the key associated with that node.


## Time Complexity

Trie trees offer efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. The time complexity of these operations is O(m), where m is the length of the string being inserted, deleted, or searched. This makes trie trees particularly well-suited for scenarios where the keys are long or share common prefixes.

## Use Cases

1. **Dictionary Implementation**: Trie trees are commonly used in the implementation of dictionaries, spell checkers, and autocomplete features due to their efficient search capabilities.

2. **IP Routing**: Tries are used in IP routers to quickly find the longest prefix match for a given destination IP address.

3. **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Trie trees are employed in autocomplete systems to efficiently provide suggestions based on the prefix entered by the user.

4. **Symbol Tables in Compilers**: Tries are used to implement symbol tables in compilers for quick retrieval of variable and function names.

5. **Contacts Applications**: Tries can be used to implement contact lists in phones, making it easy to search for contacts based on partial names.
